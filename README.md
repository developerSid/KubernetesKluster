# Kubernetes for cheapskates like me
## Setup a Self Hosted Kubernetes cluster _(for learning)_ 

## Why?
To Learn!

## Tools you will need
1. [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
   1. Since I'm using Vagrant, and VirtualBox has the best support for most things this is the easy place to start.
      I will make an effort later to support other hypervisors.
1. [Packer](https://www.packer.io)
   1. This used for building an Ubuntu box to be imported into the Vagrant managed VMs that will make up my test cluster
   1. Double check that the verison of VirtualBox installed is supported by Packer.  I've had issues in with newer 
      versions of packer not working well with older versions of VirtualBox
1. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
   1. For managing the VMs
1. [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html)
   1. Will be used for installing the different components once the VMs have been started via Vagrant
